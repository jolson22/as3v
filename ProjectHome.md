# AS3V #
AS3V is an [ActionScript 3](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ActionScript#ActionScript_3.0) [Validator](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Validator). It is a tool to check for syntactical correctness and matches code against a given set of rules.

## Code consistency ##
AS3V will help keeping code consistent by forcing the author to follow coding conventions.
The basic set of conventions AS3V will ship with are the [Flex SDK Coding Conventions](http://opensource.adobe.com/wiki/display/flexsdk/Coding+Conventions).

You are free to extend the set of AS3V rules with own [XPath](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xpath) expressions.
